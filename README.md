# Intune-Scripts
Matt's random collection of scripts related to Intune


I claim no ownership on anything that exists here, but I am sharing to keep things in one location for myself. I use Copilot, Google, and stroll through one of the many MDM bloggers repo's to find things that help me in my day to day job of managing endpoints. 

No warranty, check scripts you get from other people, be nice to others, etc, etc.
